#### Opencv-code

Basic opencv code for performing operations on images such as cropping, masking, blurring, Histogram techniques, Thresholding, Edge detection and contouring.
#### To run any code file
* Python filename.py -i path to input image

###### Some Important points to Note

* Coordinate system for Image: The origin (0, 0) of an image starts at the top-left corner of the image and increases as we move to the right and down. We specify pixels in terms of (x,y) coordinate but Image is basically defined as a matrix means <b>x represent number of columns and <b> y represents number of rows</b>. So, to specify a pixel, we first enter y and then x. 
  <br> Image[y,x]</br>
* OpenCV stores image in <b>BGR format rather than RGB format</b>
